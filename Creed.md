From the Latin _Credo_, meaning "I believe".

In [[Greek]], a creed is called a σύμβολον, _[[symbolon]]_, which originally meant half of a broken object which, when fitted to the other half, verified the bearer's identity.[^1] The Greek word passed through Latin _symbolum_ into English "symbol", which only later took on the meaning of an outward sign of something.
