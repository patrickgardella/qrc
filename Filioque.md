In the late 6th century, some Latin-speaking churches added the word _Filioque_ ("and the Son") to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] have at a later stage argued is a violation of Canon VII of the [[Third Ecumenical Council]], since the words were not included in the text by either the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] or that of [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]]. This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014. Filioque eventually became one of the main causes for the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, and the failures of the repeated union attempts.
