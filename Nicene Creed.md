First adopted at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 AD. It was later amended in 381 by the [[First Council of Constantinople]].
## Summary
The Nicene Creed was adopted to resolve the [[Arianism|Arian]] controversy, whose leader, [[Arius]], a clergyman of [[Alexandria]], "objected to [[Alexander|Alexander's]] (the bishop of the time) apparent carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation". Emperor [[Constantine]] called the [[Nicene Creed|Council at Nicaea]] to resolve the dispute in the church which resulted from the widespread adoption of [[Arius]]' teachings, which threatened to destabilize the entire empire. Following the formulation of the Nicene Creed, [[Arius]]' teachings were henceforth marked as [[heresy]].
## Heresies Addressed
* [[Arianism]]
* [[Nestorianism]] - The Son of God said to dwell in man, rather than to be a man. (i.e. "God in a bod")
* [[Origen]] - The [[Atonement]] extends even the devils. 
* [[Manicheans]] - Jesus only appeared to be a man (didn't take on the flesh).
* [[Photinus]] -  Jesus was only a man, not God.
## Details
What is known as the "Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed" or the "Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed", received this name because it was adopted at the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] held in [[Constantinople]] in 381 as a modification of the original Nicene Creed of 325. In that light, it also came to be very commonly known simply as the "Nicene Creed". It is the only authoritative ecumenical statement of the Christian faith accepted by the [[Catholic Church]] (with the addition of the [[Filioque]]), the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Church of the East]], and much of [[Protestantism]] including the [[Anglican communion]]. (The [[Apostles Creed|Apostles']] and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]] creeds are not as widely accepted.

The [[Third Ecumenical Council]] ([[Ephesus]]) reaffirmed the original 325 version of the Nicene Creed and declared that "it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different (ἑτέραν) faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicaea" (i.e., the 325 creed). The word ἑτέραν is more accurately translated as used by the council to mean "different", "contradictory", rather than "another". This statement has been interpreted as a prohibition against changing this creed or composing others, but not all accept this interpretation. This question is connected with the controversy whether a creed proclaimed by an [[ecumenical council]] is definitive in excluding not only excisions from its text but also additions to it.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] stated that the phrase _for us men, and for our salvation_ was to refute the error of [[Origen]], "who alleged that by the power of Christ's Passion even the devils were to be set free." He also stated that the phrases stating Jesus was made _incarnate by the Holy Spirit_ was to refute the [[Manicheans]] "so that we may believe that He assumed true flesh and not a phantastic body," and _He came down from Heaven_ was to refute the error of [[Photinus]], "who asserted that Christ was no more than a man." Furthermore, the phrase _and He was made man_ was to "exclude the error of [[Nestorius]], according to whose contention the Son of God ... would be said to dwell in man [rather] than to be man."
## "Local" Differences

The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the singular forms of verbs such as "I believe", in place of the plural form ("we believe") used by the council.

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that it is wrong to add "and the Son" to the Greek verb "ἐκπορευόμενον", though correct to add it to the Latin "_qui procedit_", which does not have precisely the same meaning.[^1]

The form generally used in Western churches does add "and the Son" and also the phrase "God from God", which is found in the original 325 Creed.
