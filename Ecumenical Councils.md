**Other Ecumenical Councils**
* [[Second Council of Ephesus|Second Council of Ephesus (431 AD)]] (Oriental Orthodoxy)
* [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon|Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (410 AD)]] (Churches of the East)
* The so-called [[Quinisext Council of Trullo|Quinisext Council of Trullo (692 AD)]], held between the sixth and seventh ecumenical councils, which issued organizational, liturgical and canonical rules but did not discuss theology. Only within Eastern Orthodoxy is its authority commonly considered ecumenical; however, the Orthodox do not number it among the seven general councils, but rather count it as a continuation of the fifth and sixth.
* The Roman Catholic Church does not accept the [[Quinisext Council of Trullo|Quinisext Council]] but both the Roman magisterium as well as a minority of Eastern Orthodox hierarchs and theological writers consider there to have been further ecumenical councils after the first seven (see the [Fourth Council of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Council_of_Constantinople_\(Eastern_Orthodox\) "Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)"), [Fifth Council of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Council_of_Constantinople "Fifth Council of Constantinople"), and fourteen additional [post-schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-West_Schism "East-West Schism") [ecumenical councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_ecumenical_councils "Catholic ecumenical councils") canonical for Catholics).
