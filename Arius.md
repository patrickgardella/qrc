Arius (/əˈraɪəs, ˈɛəri-/; Koinē Greek: Ἄρειος, romanized: Áreios; 250 or 256 – 336) was a [[Cyrenaic]] [[presbyter]] and ascetic]]. He has been regarded as the founder of [[Arianism]], which holds that Jesus Christ was not coeternal with God the Father, but was rather created before time. Arian theology and its doctrine regarding the nature of the Godhead showed a belief in radical subordinationism, a view notably disputed by 4th century figures such as [[Athanasius]] of [[Alexandria]].
