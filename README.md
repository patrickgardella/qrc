# Quick Reference Christianity

This is a personal quick reference guide to the history and traditions of the Christian faith. It will use the "received" traditions; meaning it will follow the traditional beliefs and history as they have been passed down through the ages.

The intention is to provide a quick reference guide, not an exhaustive history and details of everything. This is not a replacement for historical primary sources, secondary sources, or summaries, such as Wikipedia.
